# Next Feature: Daily Reports Page (`@daily-reports`)

## 🧾 Overview

- This page will **generate a customized Daily Financial Summary** (and extended reports) by analyzing user transactions and account balances from Plaid.
- Users can **select time ranges** (daily, weekly, monthly, all time) and **view category-specific reports**.
- The report is generated by passing a JSON object (from the user's MongoDB) into Gemini 2.0 flash LLM using the Vercel AI SDK.
- All output reports must be error free and provide complete, necessary information for data analysis.
- The env keys for google and gemini are setup to use out of the box, so refer to the Vercel AI SDK docs to help implement in a api route.

## 1. 📈 Data Aggregation

- **Data Source:** Retrieve user transactions and account balances from MongoDB.
  - **Transactions:** JSON array (fields: `date`, `amount`, `category`, `notes`, `isManual`)
  - **Accounts:** JSON array (fields: `name`, `type`, `current balance`)
- **API Endpoint:**
  - Create an API route (e.g., `/api/daily-reports`) to fetch data.
  - Apply query filters for the selected time range and category preferences before returning the data.
  - Support extended time ranges: **daily, weekly, monthly, and all time.**

## 2. 🤖 Gemini 2.0 Flash LLM Integration with Customization

- **LLM Prompt:** The Gemini 2.0 prompt will be dynamically generated using variables from the frontend Zod form. For example:
  ```ts
  const geminiPrompt = `
  You are a personal finance assistant generating a detailed, error-free, and customized Financial Summary for a user.

  Your goal is to provide an insightful summary that analyzes the user’s spending, income, and overall financial behavior based on the selected time range: ${timeRange}.
  Include the following elements:

  1. **Overall Overview:**
     - Total spent vs. total income
     - Net difference (savings or overspending)
     - Notable spending patterns and any outlier transactions
     - A brief analysis that varies depending on whether the report covers a day, week, month, or all time.

  2. **Time Range Analysis:**
     - For ${timeRange} reports, include trends or comparisons with previous periods when relevant.
  
  3. **Category Reports:**
     - Break down spending by category and highlight the top 1-2 spending categories.
     - Offer insights if there is an unusual pattern or if the user consistently overspends in certain categories.
  
  4. **Custom Insights:**
     - Analyze the data with error free logic to provide all necessary info for understanding financial behavior.
     - Tailor the analysis based on any additional filters or customizations provided by the user.

  Use the following input format:

  - \`transactions\`: JSON array (fields: date, amount, category, notes, isManual)
  - \`accounts\`: JSON array (fields: name, type, current balance)

  Now, based on the provided input and customization settings, generate the Financial Summary:
  `;
  ```
- **Processing Flow:**
  - On clicking "Generate Report," collect user input via a Zod form (time range and category filters).
  - Fetch the filtered JSON data from MongoDB.
  - Merge the data with user customization settings, then pass these as variables in the prompt to Gemini 2.0 through the Vercel AI SDK.
  - Render the generated report on the page.

## 3. 🎨 UI & Component Library

- **Framework:** Use **shadcn/ui** for building all UI components.
- **Customization Panel:**
  - **Zod Form for Customization:**  
    Create a form with the following fields:
    - **Time Range Filter:** Dropdown with options: Daily, Weekly, Monthly, All Time.
    - **Category Filters:** Multi-select dropdown for categories.
  - **UI Layout:**  
    The customization form should appear at the top of the page or in a sidebar.
  - **Action:**  
    Include a “Generate Report” button that triggers:
      - Form validation using Zod.
      - API call for data retrieval.
      - Generation of the Gemini 2.0 prompt with user-selected variables.
- **Interactive Charts & Data Visuals (Optional):**
  - Integrate charts (e.g., using Chart.js or Recharts) to graphically display trend and category analysis.
  - Allow users to interact with visualizations for deeper insights.

- **Vercel AI SDK Integration:**
  - Follow the [Vercel AI SDK documentation](https://sdk.vercel.ai/providers/ai-sdk-providers/google-generative-ai) for sending the prompt and retrieving the AI-generated summary.
  - Ensure error handling and smooth user interaction during the generation process.

## 4. ⚙️ Integration & Processing Logic

1. **Data Fetching and Filtering:**
   - Build the `/api/daily-reports` endpoint to filter transactions based on the selected time range and any category filters.
   - Return a JSON object containing:
     - `transactions`: Filtered transactions array.
     - `accounts`: Up-to-date account balances.

2. **Zod Form Integration:**
   - Implement a Zod schema on the frontend for validating user input.
   - Ensure the form collects:
     - Time Range: Must be one of "Daily", "Weekly", "Monthly", or "All Time".
     - Categories: Array of strings for filtering transactions.

3. **Gemini 2.0 Prompt Execution:**
   - After form validation, generate the prompt dynamically with inserted variables (`timeRange`, selected categories, etc.).
   - Invoke the Gemini 2.0 flash LLM via the Vercel AI SDK and pass the merged JSON data and customized prompt.

4. **Render Report & Interactive Analysis:**
   - Render the generated Financial Summary in a user-friendly, styled component.
   - Display interactive charts and visual elements for further analysis of spending trends and category breakdowns.

5. **Testing and Error Handling:**
   - Confirm the report displays all required information correctly.
   - Verify that customization options work error free and that the output report is comprehensive for data analysis.
