# Next Feature: Q/A Assistant Page (`/assistant`)

## 🧾 Overview

- This page will serve as a **Q/A assistant** where the Gemini AI chatbot can answer user questions with full context from the user's data.
- When the page loads, the assistant will retrieve and update the full MongoDB user object, making it available for context during conversations.
- The chatbot interface will leverage **prebuilt UI hooks and components from the Vercel AI SDK** to ensure a consistent, easy-to-integrate experience.
- Users can ask personalized questions, receive contextual answers, and interact with the assistant as it “knows” their entire data profile.

## 1. 📡 Data Integration

- **Data Source:** Retrieve the full MongoDB user object.

    - Ensure that the complete user profile, including transactions, account balances, and other relevant data, is fetched when the page loads.
    - Keep the user data updated in real time or on specific user actions (such as refreshing the chat).

- **Backend/API Considerations:**
    - Create or extend an API endpoint (e.g., `/api/userdata`) that returns the full user object.
    - Use proper authentication (e.g., via Clerk or similar) to ensure secure access to the user’s data.

## 2. 🤖 Gemini AI Chatbot Integration

- **Prebuilt Vercel AI SDK UI Components:**

    - Use the [Vercel AI SDK Chatbot components](https://sdk.vercel.ai/docs/ai-sdk-ui/chatbot) to build the chat UI.
    - Implement persistence for chatbot messages with the [Chatbot Message Persistence](https://sdk.vercel.ai/docs/ai-sdk-ui/chatbot-message-persistence) utilities for an improved experience.
    - Follow the [Vercel AI SDK UI documentation](https://sdk.vercel.ai/docs/ai-sdk-ui) for overall integration and configuration tips.

- **Chatbot Initialization:**
    - On page load, initialize the chatbot with the full user data as context.
    - Ensure that the Gemini AI model has access to all the necessary information so that it can answer user-specific questions effectively.

## 3. 🎨 UI & Component Library

- **Framework:** Use the prebuilt UI hooks and components from the Vercel AI SDK.

    - Example components include chat window, message list, input field, and send button.
    - Ensure that the design aligns with your app’s overall style for a seamless user experience.

- **Chatbot Interface:**

    - **Chat Area:** A section to display the conversation with the assistant.
    - **Input Field:** A text input field for users to type their questions.
    - **Send Button:** A button to submit the query.
    - **Message Persistence:** Utilize the built-in persistence logic to save and restore chat history.

- **Responsive Design:**
    - Ensure the chatbot interface is fully responsive and works seamlessly on mobile and desktop devices.

## 4. ⚙️ Integration & Processing Logic

1. **User Data Fetching:**

    - On page load, fetch the full MongoDB user object from `/api/userdata`.
    - Store this data in a suitable client-side state management solution (e.g., React Context, Zustand).

2. **Chatbot Context Setup:**

    - Integrate the fetched user data into the chatbot context. This ensures that every user query is processed with the full profile available.
    - Pass the context to the Gemini AI model through the Vercel AI SDK configuration.

3. **UI Component Configuration:**

    - Use Vercel AI SDK’s prebuilt components to set up the chat UI.
    - Customize the UI as needed while maintaining the defaults to leverage built-in features such as message persistence and error handling.

4. **Message Handling:**

    - On user input, send the question along with the current conversation history and user context to Gemini AI.
    - Receive and display the assistant’s response in the chat window.
    - Implement error handling to manage any API errors gracefully and inform the user if something goes wrong.

5. **Persistence:**
    - Enable chatbot message persistence so that the conversation history is retained even if the user navigates away or refreshes the page.
    - Consider using local storage or a backend persistence layer as per the Vercel AI SDK guidelines.

## ✅ Summary of Steps

1. **API & Data Integration:**

    - Build or extend the `/api/userdata` endpoint to return the full MongoDB user object.
    - Fetch and store user data on page load.

2. **Chatbot UI Setup:**

    - Set up the chatbot interface on the `/assistant` page using Vercel AI SDK prebuilt UI components.
    - Integrate responsive and accessible design principles.

3. **Gemini AI Integration:**

    - Initialize the Gemini AI chatbot with user context.
    - Configure message persistence to maintain chat history.

4. **Testing and Quality Assurance:**
    - Validate that the chatbot receives and processes user data correctly.
    - Ensure that all user queries are answered based on full context.
    - Test for errors and ensure the interface is robust and user-friendly.

## 📝 Important Notes

- **User Context:** The assistant must always have access to up-to-date user information for context-aware responses.
- **Vercel AI SDK:** Follow the [Vercel AI SDK Chatbot documentation](https://sdk.vercel.ai/docs/ai-sdk-ui/chatbot) and [Message Persistence docs](https://sdk.vercel.ai/docs/ai-sdk-ui/chatbot-message-persistence) closely for a robust implementation.
- **Security & Authentication:** Ensure all API calls involving user data are authenticated and secure.
- **Error Handling:** Build robust error handling to provide clear feedback if data fetching or AI interactions fail.

## 🔨 Let's Start

- **Step 1:** Build/extend the `/api/userdata` endpoint to fetch the full MongoDB user object and validate access.
- **Step 2:** Implement the data fetching logic on page load to store the user object.
- **Step 3:** Set up the chatbot interface using the Vercel AI SDK’s prebuilt UI components.
- **Step 4:** Configure the Gemini AI model to include full user context when processing Q/A interactions.
- **Step 5:** Test thoroughly with different user scenarios and ensure message persistence works as intended.

> Begin by ensuring that the user data is correctly fetched and available on the `/assistant` page, then integrate the Vercel AI SDK components to create a seamless Q/A chatbot experience.
